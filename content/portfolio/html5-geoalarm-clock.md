This is a HTML5 (JS/CSS/HTML) app which 'rings' (plays audio) when the user is within a mile (configurable) of a destination which they define. Use case is to enable public commuters on buses (or other transportation where an internet or gps connection is available) to get more minutes of sleep in. Utilizes Google Maps JS API.
